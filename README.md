# Functional-Connectivity-Analysis-of-EEG-Signals-Using-Wavelet-Coherence
This project analyzes EEG functional connectivity using wavelet coherence. It compares alpha-band connectivity between resting and motor imagery states in multiple subjects. Statistical tests and network-based methods assess connectivity changes, providing insights into brain dynamics and a framework for future studies.
