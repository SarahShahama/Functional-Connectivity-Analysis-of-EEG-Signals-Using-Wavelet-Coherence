# Functional-Connectivity-Analysis-of-EEG-Signals-Using-Wavelet-Coherence
This project performs a functional connectivity analysis of EEG data using wavelet coherence, focusing on alpha-band interactions during resting and motor imagery tasks. 

# Project Overview

EEG provides a powerful window into brain activity, and understanding how different regions communicate is key for insights into neural function. This project applies Morlet wavelet-based coherence analysis to measure frequency-specific synchrony between EEG channels and statistically compares connectivity patterns between resting and motor imagery conditions across subjects.

# Features

Preprocessing of raw EEG data with notch and bandpass filtering, resampling, and detrending.

Extraction of time-frequency information using Morlet wavelet transform.

Computation of alpha-band (8â€“13 Hz) coherence matrices.

Statistical tests including edge-wise paired t-tests with FDR correction and Network-Based Statistics (NBS) for identifying significant connectivity differences.

Visualization of coherence matrices and brain connectivity graphs.

# Data

Uses the PhysioNet Motor Imagery dataset, working with the first five subjects and runs corresponding to rest and motor imagery.

# How to Run

The project is implemented using Python and relies on libraries such as MNE, NumPy, SciPy, NetworkX, and Matplotlib. See requirements.txt for exact dependencies.

# Results

Identified wavelet coherence patterns in the alpha frequency band.

Found no statistically significant edges or subnetworks after correction, but observed promising raw effect sizes for some channel pairs.

Established a reusable pipeline for EEG functional connectivity analysis.

# Future Directions

Expand analysis to larger datasets for increased power.

Explore other frequency bands or task conditions.

Apply findings to brain-computer interface or clinical research.
